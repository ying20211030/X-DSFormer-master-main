X-DSFormer, which integrates frequency modulation and wavelet sub-band guided dual-domain collaboration into an efficient Transformer framework to enhance X-ray image denoising performance. 

> 🔧 Code coming soon upon paper acceptance.

This repository will host the official implementation of **X-DSFormer**, Dual-domain synergy of frequency modulation and Wavelet sub-band guidance in an efficient Transformer for X-ray image denoising. The model integrates frequency modulation and wavelet sub-band guided dual-domain collaboration into an efficient Transformer framework to enhance X-ray image denoising performance. 

## 📌 Highlights
- 🔍 achieves 51.95 dB PSNR and 0.9956 SSIM in weld DR image denoising task.
-  📈 A self-constructed paired noisy–reference weld DR image dataset.
- ⚙️ Good generalization performance in CT slice denoising.
- 🏭 While denoising, defect visibility is enhanced, demonstrating strong engineering application value.
